Overall call-after rate (for October) is around 3–5% (e.g., 3.3%, 3.4%, 5.6%).

On your page-level table, many rows show 7–12% call-after rate, and:

When he takes a simple average of the column in Excel, it shows ~11%.

Even when filtering pages whose name contains “login”, it stays around 10%.

He finds it odd that login pages show ~7–11% when overall is ~3–5%.

He suspects:

Possible double counting of sessions or calls.

Or that the metric definition at the page level is not the same as how they compute overall call-after rate.

He also hints:

People visit multiple pages per session, so page-level averages can be higher than the overall rate—but “double seems suspicious”.

He wants you to “look at the raw data” and confirm why these numbers are so high.

So your task:
👉 Either find a bug in your SQL / logic, or show clearly that the higher number is expected given how the subset or page-level metric is defined.
